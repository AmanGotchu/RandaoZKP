This is work in progress for tooling around the recursive zk-SNARKs, whose circuits have not been compiled yet.

Circom circuits requires its inputs to be in a specific format.  We modified Yi Sun's notebooks to do some similar preprocessing.

These are not well documented, but we are happy to discuss in person/twitter.
